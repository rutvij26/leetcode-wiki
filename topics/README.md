### **Explanation**

- **Difficulty to Learn**: This is a subjective assessment of how difficult each topic is to understand and implement. Topics marked as "High" might require more practice and experience to master.
- **Return on Investment**: This is a rough estimate of how often these topics appear in coding interviews and how valuable they are for solving problems efficiently.
